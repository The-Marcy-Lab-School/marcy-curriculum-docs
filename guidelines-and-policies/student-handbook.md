# Student Handbook

## **Mission, Our Promise, Pillars of Character**

Welcome to The Marcy Lab School! We are so happy to have you as a part of our family. This handbook is designed to be a roadmap for you. Here, you'll get an understanding of our mission and values, our hybrid school culture, a look into the daily, weekly, and yearly life as a Fellow, what you can expect _from us_ as a Marcy Lab Software Engineering Fellow, and what we expect _of you._

#### **The Marcy Lab School Mission:**

Our mission is to build economic mobility. We help young people accelerate their careers. Our yearlong college alternative provides young adults from underestimated backgrounds with the skills, the habits, and the network necessary to launch a rewarding, purpose-driven career in the tech sector.

#### **Our Logo:**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Marcy Labs Logo.png" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The logo of The Marcy Lab School is the _Fawodhie,_ the West African Adinkra Symbol that translates to "Independence, Freedom, and Emancipation." Directly translated, it means "that with independence, comes great responsibility." This symbol is a source of inspiration for our community each and every day as we support our fellows in building their righteous pathways into the middle class for themselves and those who come after them. As they prepare to step into opportunity, independence, wealth, and mobility, this symbol brings us back to their driving force: that path they're building is not just for them to walk but, rather, is the path that paves the way for all of those to follow.

#### Our Promise to You:

By the end of this year, you will know yourself, your worth, and your standard of excellence. And you will mobilize these to step into wealth and become a leader in your community.

#### Our Pillars of Character:

<details>

<summary><strong>Unwavering Discipline üèÉüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</strong></summary>

We hold ourselves accountable to a relentlessly high bar day in and day out, in ways big and small.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Bold Determination üßóüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</summary>

Our goals are audacious because we refuse to sell ourselves short. While we will experience failure, doubt, and fatigue, we will persist because we see where we want to go and are 100% committed to getting there. There is no turning back.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Tough Love üíú</summary>

No matter the circumstances, we are worthy of love and hard work and will push ourselves to do the wholehearted labor of stepping into our own power. We deserve every opportunity to realize success, wealth, and solutions for ourselves and our communities.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Ingenious Curiosity üß†</summary>

We are wildly talented, yet also have a world of brilliance and potential to unlock. Our passion for thinking and figuring it out will always guide us in the right direction, and we will leave no stone unturned to solve problems and build solutions. When we get lost, curiosity can bring us home.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Collective Responsibility üåç</summary>

We care deeply for each other and are beholden to our networks and communities. We are responsible to them as much as to ourselves, in our daily work, in our future aspirations, and in our ultimate solutions. We are in this together, and we carry this value with us wherever we go.

</details>

## **Why Hybrid?**

In Marcy Lab's first year, we were 100% in-person! Like the rest of the world, each day, our founding Fellows would arrive at our campus to learn in community with one another. The Marcy Lab School is an alternative to college, and it felt that way for students on our campus. Through our in-person classes, community moments, company visits, brave discussions in Leadership Seminar, and countless hours studying beside each other, Fellows got the college experience that they always dreamed of but never got: deep friendships, personal and professional development, and the chance to hold each other down through the most rigorous computer science program in the country.

On March 16, 2020, two weeks after the first COVID-19 case was found in New York and one week before New York City was announced as the epicenter of the pandemic, Reuben, Maya, and Marcy's founding Fellows made the decision to close our doors, and they re-built The Marcy Lab School as a remote program to keep our students and their families safe. Suddenly, we sat in a time of great uncertainty and collective grief- there was just one simple question: would Marcy Lab be able to serve our students remotely?

As we supported Fellows in building their home offices and took our classes on Zoom, our coaching calls over the phone and on Tandem, and students began relying on Canvas and Slack to support each other with work, we started to see some of the _benefits_ of remote instruction! First, technical instruction- with our incredible Lead Instructors, makes _sense_ on Zoom. Through screen sharing, polling, and code-a-longs, for note-taking and documentation, the benefits of virtual learning started to show themselves.

With the safety of our students and their families continuing to govern our decisions, and our founding class graduating remotely, our Class of 2021 began The Marcy Lab School for our first fully _remote_ year! We got really _good_ at virtual learning, and we saw so many other benefits. Students got more time back in their day that was lost on their commute, they had more flexibility, and our virtual community on Tandem began to flourish. Yet, there were a few big drawbacks, the biggest being the impact on _our community._ Our Fellows missed one another‚Äî they wished that they could work on problem sets together, grab coffee and catch up about Netflix specials, or simply _be_ together as they made their way through this challenging curriculum. They missed having a campus they could work from, free from distractions. As the year went on, working from home with the day-to-day hustle and bustle of their homes became difficult.

So, why hybrid?! Building Marcy in COVID taught us so much, and we've decided to continue building The Marcy Lab School as a hybrid program to give students the _best_ of both worlds. Each week, students will have hybrid Monday-Friday schedule with 3 on-campus days and 2 remote days. We've invested in a beautiful 16,000-square-foot campus to provide you all with an inspiring workspace you can call your own, and have found the most incredible Computer Science Instructors who will be leading your learning. We've hired the best instructional team to support you technically on your in-person and remote days, and finally, the world's best Program Managers, your coaches, to support your leadership development through in-person Leadership Seminar, coaching conversations, and whole school moments!

We are so, so excited to be able to be able to present you all with a schedule that we believe will help you get every single drop out of what this program has to offer!

## **Daily/Weekly Calendar**

So, what does our schedule include?! At The Marcy Lab School, you will typically be in class from roughly 9:00am to 4:30pm during the weekdays. Below, find descriptions on what you can expect within your daily schedule!

**Mindful Morning:**

You will begin your days at Marcy with our practice of Mindful Morning. This shared ritual allows us to take space and set an intention for the day as a group through guided meditation, practicing gratitude, and morning pages/journaling.

**Code Challenge:** Code Challenge is where you will be given the tools to beat the biggest hurdle of entry _into_ the career: the technical interview. These sessions will be where you will prep each day for the technical interview and learn how to tackle the coding interview with your Associate Instructor.

**Technical Lecture (Remote & In Person):**

Every day, you will have Technical Lecture with your Lead Instructor. This is your main learning space for the technical content throughout this next year. You will be expected to come to lecture prepared, too, having read and reviewed material prior so you can jump right into the details of the topic!

**Labs & Lab Review:**

Within your daily schedule, there is designated work time called Labs. During this time, you will be actively making progress on any upcoming assignments that are due. Lab Review will then come at the end of the day, and your Lead Instructor, or Associate Instructor, will use this space to review any concepts and/or problem sets from the homework.

**Office Hours:**

Our Associate Instructors (AI) will lead Office Hours four times a week for a select group of Fellows as additional support for the technical content. You can see Office Hours as ‚Äúsmall group tutoring!‚Äù It‚Äôs an amazing time to make sure that you have your content down and to get a ton of technical support in a small group with all of your AI‚Äôs attention.

**Stand Down & Weekly Closeout:**

To end your day, you will come together with your cohort for Stand Down. This time will be used to complete your day, reflect on what went well (and what didn‚Äôt), and then set a plan for the next day. Just like Mindful Morning, this ritual is designed to help us take space and reflect as a group on what is to come.

To end the week, you will have Weekly Closeout in place of Stand Down. This time will include some of the rituals you will read about below and gives us the time to finish out our weeks together while also getting prepared for the weekend.

**Leadership Seminar:**

Twice a week, you will have Leadership Seminar led by your Program Manager. You will be engaging in deep discussions that allow you to question the systems you are a part of and critically think through what meaningful change can be in any opportunity within and beyond your time at Marcy. In these sessions, you will start the year discussing identities, including race, gender, sexuality, etc., and later on, will dive into sessions focused on career aptitude, financial literacy, and building tech that positively impacts our world.

_**Notes:**_

* On in-person days, class does not begin until 9:30am, with our days still ending by 4:30pm. We've provided you an additional 30 minutes to make more time for your commutes!
* Occasionally, we will add in a block to the schedule for Scoping & Goal Setting. Throughout your year at Marcy, you will be balancing multiple streams of work, and this shared space allows us to hold each other accountable to the work by naming our specific focus for the day.
* While you are only _required_ to attend The Marcy Lab School on in-person days, our office will be open for you to come work there 7 days a week if that is what you prefer!

## **Remote Expectations**

In 2020, The Marcy Lab School decided to be a remote-first school. In this section, you'll learn about _why_ we are still doing remote learning, _how_ we do it, and _what support you can expect from us in_ setting up your remote world to be a joyful and productive experience for you!

_**Why**_ are we investing in remote learning?

When you first think of a "remote days" you may think "Oh! That's just classes on Zoom!" Don't worry, we thought that too when the COVID Pandemic first hit! We've learned, though, just how many benefits there are in being a remote-first school as we train you as software engineers. Below, find the biggest contributing reasons we have committed to remote learning this year:

* Building Your Skillset as Remote Communicators: Our world has changed beneath our feet as offices have closed, many schools and colleges have gone online, and businesses and industries around our nation have had to shift their strategy to provide remote work. With this change in our economy has come a change in the skillsets that you must now be fluent in in order to enter it. Collaboration is no longer as easy as turning to the person next to you, going up to your manager to ask a question, or using a whiteboard to capture your thought process when you're stuck. Now, workers have had to rely on "asynchronous communication" (e-mail, virtual communication, Zoom, Slack, data sharing and file transmission) to keep their work going outside of offices. This is a whole new skillset that we must prepare you for in this next chapter of our digital world, and we know that in this case, we learn how to do this by _doing_. In our virtual world, we can promise that you will become fluent remote and asynchronous communicators and we are confident that our remote world will be able to provide you with the support and practice to do so.
* Flexibility: We understand that you have responsibilities to your families and communities outside of Marcy, too. Last year, we learned that remote days provided our team and fellow community with more flexibility to take care of life.
* Time Management: One of your biggest learnings this year will be in learning how each of you manage your time and workload. We are excited to help you figure this out each step of the way as you build your own independence as a Software Engineer. One gift of our remote world is that it buys you back time that would often be lost on the commute. This has allowed us to build in time into your days, weeks, and our year, for work blocks, mental health days, and structured discovery of how you work best.

_**How**_ do we do remote learning at The Lab?

We are purposeful and intentional with how we use Zoom with a split of both "Cameras On" and "Cameras Off" moments of the day.

*   üì∏Camera's on: \*\*It is a **non-negotiable** that when you are learning virtually that you keep your camera on. This is so that your Lead Instructors and Program Managers can _see_ you as they teach you and coach you! We expect you to keep our cameras on during:

    * _All_ technical lectures and during Leadership Seminar
    * As instructed during Code Challenge
    * Community moments: After journaling in Mindful Morning, Feelings Friday, and Close Outs
    * During sessions with employer partners throughout the year

    Teaching rests on understanding where your students are at, and our team relies on body language and person-to-person connection, presence, and engagement as we deliver you our virtual programming. If there is a reason that you **cannot** be on Camera, you must communicate that to your Lead Instructor or Program Manager through the chat box.
* üì∑Camera's off: We also want to protect your energy and know that being "on" all day in front of your computer can be tiring. We believe it is so important to manage our collective energy, so we've made sure there is a balance of "off camera time" throughout the day- and these moments have been intentionally tied to moments of introspection, work time, and community moments that require less vulnerability. Please feel free to keep your cameras off for the beginning of Mindful Mornings, in our virtual lounges on Tandem, and for shared or independent work-time in Labs.
* Zoom Display Names: \*\*\*\*We create a safe remote space for all community members and future employees by ensuring that our display names capture our full names and pronouns. More on this in Leadership Seminar!
* Honoring Privacy: \*\*\*\*We also honor the privacy of each other and our loved ones, siblings, family members, by using zoom backgrounds whenever we want/need to!

‚òÆÔ∏è Mental Health Fridays and Offline Lunch Hours:

We are living in strange and unprecedented times, and this takes it's toll on us all in different ways! As such, it is so important to us that you have moments for you to care for you and your loved ones factored into your schedule on a daily and weekly basis. While you'll be responsible for keeping up with your work and meeting your deadlines, it's important to us that you have time offline throughout the week that is sacred for you.

üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶ Managing expectations:

It's important to acknowledge that many of you are living in full households, with little or bigger siblings, nieces and nephews, family members and pets! ü•∞ It will be important that you communicate with your family about both your workload and our hybrid schedule, setting some expectations of what they can expect from you this next year. You will have roughly 40 hours a week of where will be immersed in your schoolwork. **Remote days are not "free" days at Marcy Lab.** However, we're hopeful that our daily schedule will allow you to both be a presence at home while also tending to your school responsibilities. Our Program Managers will work to gain an understanding your environment during your first coaching conversations, and will be there to help you set yourself up for success.

## **In-Person Expectations**

**Keeping our Community Safe:**

One of Marcy's Core Values is Collective Responsibility, and this values informs and governs so many of our policies. We are so appreciative of all you have _already_ done to keep our community safe in the age of COVID-19, including taking all necessary steps to be vaccinated by the first day of school. We will continue to ask our students and staff to be vigilant in keeping our community safe through the following policies:

* **Wash hands regularly:** We ask that you remain vigilant in washing your hands throughout the day.
* **Use a mask when needed or if you would prefer to wear one:** You are not required to wear a mask on campus, but you are welcome to if you would like. We want you to do whatever makes you feel most safe and secure, and no one will ever ask any questions about that.
* **Communicate with your Program Managers if you are exposed to COVID-19 and get tested:** If you have been exposed to COVID-19 or you learn that somebody in your family, your community, or a friend you have been in contact with tests positive for COVID, we ask all members of our community to get tested and rapidly communicate as a part of our collective responsibility for the health of our community. If you have been exposed to COVID-19 or are experiencing similar symptoms, please notify your Program Manager as soon as you can. They will work with you to problem solve, and will ask that you provide proof of a negative test, PCR or Rapid, _before_ returning to in-person instruction.
* **Respect the boundaries and needs of all community members.**

## **Academic Course Outlines**

We are so excited to make our way through our two important curriculums together. In this section, you'll find the [Software Engineering Curriculum Overview](https://www.notion.so/The-Marcy-Lab-School-Software-Engineering-Curriculum-Overview-4ff3aad7fdac4773a14f78a9374897a8?pvs=21) and the Leadership Seminar Curriculum (linked below).

Leadership & Development Curriculum Overview.pdf

## **Rituals**

**Stand Ups and Stand Downs:**

During project weeks at Marcy, you will engage regularly in Stand Ups and Stand Downs. These are meetings that are used heavily in the tech industry to keep teams accountable to their work, track progress, and determine what is need to help move projects forward each day.

With Stand Up, you will typically give a quick recap of where you are at, what your focus is for that specific day, and what obstacles you need to overcome to reach your goal. Stand Down during project weeks serves as the follow up meeting where you will share updates on what you were able to complete during the day, any additional hurdles that came up, and necessary updates that let us know what progress you were able to make on your work overall.

**Fellow Of The Week:** Every week, you and your peers select a Fellow of the Week who embodied or lived into our core values each week! When you are selected as the fellow of the week, it's your job to keep an eye on your team and look for the ways they are shining. During Weekly Closeout, you share the core values you saw this person live into and what inspired you to choose them as our Fellow of the Week! It's then up to them to choose the next Fellow of the Week! üåü

**Thoughtful Thursdays:**

Every week, we will come together as a community in our ritual called "Thoughtful Thursdays!" We cherish this weekly ritual to be in community together as human beings. Thoughtful Thursdays is an unprompted and open space for each member of our community to share their feelings, _any_ feelings, updates, thoughts, or reflections. This space has been so helpful for our community in processing current events, supporting each other through hardships or times, reflecting on the week, or in sharing anything on our heart. After each person shares, our community snaps, and the next community members get to share.

**Family Fridays:**

On our yearly calendar, we'll have "Family Fridays" approximately once per month. Family Fridays will be at the end of the week in the afternoon and we will come together for in-person, safe, meetups as a community. Often, these Family Fridays will build off a specific Leadership Seminar topic, serve as a close for a Leadership Seminar unit, or be times to come together as a community before holiday breaks. (MarcyGiving, Holiday Send Off, etc!)

***

#### Student Feedback and Input

At The Marcy Lab School, we believe in the notion of "getting 1% better every day." And that applies to us as an organization, too! In your interviews, we reminded each one of you that by joining us, you would be the pioneers of helping us build a remote world for the first time, and we meant it. We know that we are not perfect, and we constantly want your feedback, your ideas, and your honest take on your experience at The Marcy Lab School for all those who come after you. After every project, unit, or coaching conversation, we want to know how it _felt for you_, the highs and the lows, and what else you would like to see happen here at The Lab.

**Feedback Friday:** Every Friday, before Shout Outs and Fellow of the Week, we will ask you to reflect on the week that you had through a Weekly Survey called "Feedback Friday" to share with us any highlights or challenges, moments or rituals you enjoyed, or ideas you have to make our program each better. We read each piece of feedback carefully, and we work to respond to each idea, highlight, or challenge thoughtfully.

### Student Support

**Coaching:** One of the first things you read when you started reading this handbook was our promise to you, that by the end of this year, will know yourself, your worth, and your standard of excellence. Most of all, that you will know how to mobilize these in order to step into wealth and become a leader in your community and for all those that come after you. And, we know that this is hard work that you can't do alone ‚Äî this is where your Program Managers come in! Your Program Managers are your in-house support system (in addition to your peers,) your academic advisor, your career counselor, your accountability partner, and your biggest cheerleader all in one. Together, you set personal goals and they help you reach them. Whether you are paralyzed with anxiety when public speaking, need help pushing your immigration paperwork through, or they have surmountable at-home, personal, or family barriers, this is the kind of "executive coaching" that CEO's at fortune 500 companies depend on, and we believe that you deserve the exact same thing, future CEO! üòé

In many ways, Program Managers also serve as "HR" here at The Lab, and they are who you should go to if there has been a violation of a code of conduct or if a challenge comes up with another peer that you are struggling with.

_So what are coaching conversations?_

You will have a "coaching conversation" once every few weeks for 30-45 minutes at a time. These will be planned sessions with activities around your goals and your mindsets, and this time is 100% for you. Coaching conversations are rooted in building trust and creating a safe space for you to process your progress towards your goals, to cultivate leadership mindsets, to process your challenges, wins and disappointments, to challenge any limiting beliefs, provide you with an empowering and personal toolkit, and most importantly, to remind you of your brilliance!

**Thoughtful Thursdays:** While we each make our way through the world as whole people, we wanted to make space for unstructured time for us to come together as a community to share and reflect _anything_ that is on our minds. We call this Thoughtful Thursdays! Every Friday morning, in lieu of our morning routine, we use this time to share and connect (if we want to) anything that we are feeling or thinking about- whether it's moments of imposter syndrome, something taking place politically or through current events that you are processing, a positive personal update, a current challenge you're facing, or TRULY anything else!

**Family Chats:** There may be times this year when you are struggling to meet our academic or career-fluency expectations. In these cases, we always want to be there to support you and get you back on track. If there is a pattern of you falling behind, arriving late, missing assignments, or not showing up in the way that you need to, you may be invited to a "Family Chat" with your Program Managers, Instructors, or Reuben and Maya to problem solve together and get you back on track. üíú

### Networking:

**Career Talks and Guest Speakers:**

At The Marcy Lab School, you will often hear us refer to "social capital," which for so many is the biggest benefit of colleges and universities. At The Marcy Lab School, one of the most important things that we do is support you in building your network by bringing dynamic industry professionals and leaders in to meet you through "career talks." When Career Talks and Guest Speakers come to The Lab, it's because they are people who you can learn from personally or professionally, who are interested in hiring Marcy Lab Engineers, or whom have power or influence at your dream companies. During Career Talks and Guest Lectures, it is your chance to shine, to ask thoughtful questions, to engage fully, and most of all, to learn and enjoy! As the year goes on and you get closer to your first day on the job, our career talks and guest speakers become more and more frequent. After each career talk, you get to add one more person to your LinkedIn network, and you have another professional relationship in your life who can serve as a cheerleader, thought partner, connector and resource for you. üôèüèæ

**Company Visits:**

In previous years, we often visited companies such as Google, Microsoft, 2U, Democracy Works, or The New York Times for you to get a feel of what "office life" you enjoy the most. The Partnerships Team will be planning visits to companies _and_ visits to Marcy Lab HQ! We hope to be able to take you to a variety of company visits for you to get a feel for the kinds of offices you would like to show up to every day! Sometimes, we will also have virtual company visits \*\*\*\*in their place, where you will get a chance to meet members of the team virtually, learn more about the brand, and begin getting a sense of the company cultures that you enjoy the most.

## **Code of Conduct**

The Marcy Lab School takes pride in our responsibility to prepare you for your career, our responsibility to your family and your community, and most of all, our responsibility to _you as a whole person._ We take pride in the work we pour into helping you meet your bar for excellence, of the ways we prepare you for the industry, and finally, for the social and educational atmosphere of our campus. Whether learning online or in person, the idea of learning as a connected community that supports and lifts one another up is central to our school culture as we work to create, to build, and to lead the tech sector.

We expect all Marcy Lab School fellows, faculty, teachers, mentors, guests, and friends to help us create a safe, positive, and empowering environment for everyone. As such, we hold each other accountable for conduct in the same way that you would be at future employers. Below, find our Code of Conduct. Let's build a place and community where we can achieve more together than we ever could alone!

## **Fair Treatment, Inclusivity, and Respect for All Community Members**

It is fundamental to our culture that all Marcy Lab fellows should treat each other and their instructors fairly, honestly, with dignity and respect. A culture of teamwork and trust in which fellows and staff communicate openly will help our fellows achieve our bold goals. It is our hope that all fellows act with integrity, and that they must not participate, initiate, or perpetuate any gossiping, rumor milling, or discussing trusted personal or confidential matters about other fellows with one another. If you hear or have any issues/concerns, please reach out to Maya, Chief Program Officer, directly.

## **Attendance (& Tardiness)**

Just like any job, attendance at Marcy Lab is required and a key component of your success. Attendance means being on time and attending all scheduled sessions including mindful mornings, code challenges, tech discussion, classes (lecture and leadership seminar), community time, coaching and school meetings. **Every day, Instructors will take daily attendance in Mindful Morning.** We expect you to be _on time and on camera_ for **every** virtual or in-person class in our "Camera's On" spaces. Failure to be on camera in these spaces will result in an absence.

**Attendance requirements are:**

* Students are required to maintain a 95% average attendance rate.
* No more than 4 absences (pro-actively communicated to your Program Manager ) per fall and spring term.
* Three tardies = one absence.

A student who is ill, or who has a family emergency, should contact their Program Manager, Associate Instructor, and Lead Instructor as soon as possible to let them know. If absent, you will be held responsible for taking initiative to get caught up on anything you missed.

## **Work Submission**

This program is designed to provide fellows with the knowledge, versatility, skills, network, leadership, and career coaching to be employed as a software engineer in one year. Thus, it is crucial that each assignment and deliverable is treated like an on-the-job assignment, project, or product for us to do right on our promise. To be able to fully prepare you for your career, we hold you to a high standard of excellence, marked by **firm deadlines** that you must meet _on time._ All fellows are **expected to meet deadlines at a rate of 90%,** and must proactively communicate to the relevant instructor by e-mail or slack if there is a barrier that will keep you from doing so. Because of our high standard of excellence, it is common for instructors to ask fellows to **resubmit work that has not yet met our bar**. If an instructor asks a fellow to resubmit an assignment, fellows are expected to implement the given feedback and turn in an improved version of their assignment _within 48 hours_ of the when the feedback was given.

## **Conduct**

Fellows are considered to have violated the Code of Conduct when they have exhibited any of the unacceptable behaviors outlined below or have displayed a pattern of behavior that is deemed inconsistent with The Marcy Lab School values. Violations of the Code of Conduct should be escalated to Maya, Chief Program Officer, and are cause for dismissal from The Marcy Lab School Software Engineering Fellowship.

**Unacceptable behaviors include:** Harassing, abusive, disrespectful, discriminatory, derogatory, or violent conduct and plagiarism.

**Smoke, Drug, and Alcohol-Free Campus:** The Marcy Lab School strives to provide a safe, trusting environment for students, staff, and our network. As such, we have adopted a policy of being alcohol, smoke, and drug-free campus (even if you are above 21!) This is a non-negotiable policy and applies to all after-school community gatherings, networking events, Family Fridays, or fundraising celebrations. Students found to have violated this policy will be asked to leave the premises immediately and are subject to dismissal from our Fellowship.

_Note: There may be events hosted on campus where alcohol is served ‚Äî regardless of age, consumption of alcohol is off the table for all Marcy Lab School students._

**Sexual Misconduct:** Sexual misconduct is a broad term that encompasses any unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature that is committed without consent or by force. An act of sexual misconduct represents a fundamental failure to respect the intrinsic worth and dignity of another, and thus, The Marcy Lab School has a zero-tolerance sexual misconduct policy. This forbids the following (but is not limited to):

* Engaging in sexual behavior through Zoom and on campus
* Peer to Peer sexual harassment in the form of violent language, assaultive behavior, or unwanted touching at or outside of Marcy Lab School in-person events
* Inappropriate or sexual language in person or on any of our virtual communication tools (Zoom, Tandem, Slack)

In response to any reported sexual misconduct, The Marcy Lab School will take the appropriate steps to assess and investigate such reports in provisions of this handbook, our board of directors, and The Marcy Lab School Leadership team.

## **Academic Integrity and Plagiarism Policy**

The Marcy Lab Fellows are expected to uphold their responsibilities with the utmost transparency and honesty in all aspects. We know that by carving out this path, we are carving a path for all who come after us. While we encourage collaboration, teamwork, and collective problem solving, we do not condone cheating, plagiarism, or academic shortcuts. Fellows who violate this policy or who are suspected to have violated this policy will be interviewed by relevant staff to determine the course of action. Below, find all things that we constitute as "cheating" or "plagiarism."

_Cheating occurs when a fellow has availed him/herself of an unfair or disallowed advantage which includes but is not limited to:_

* Theft of unauthorized access to an exam, answer key, or other graded work from previous cohorts
* Use of an alternate, stand-in or proxy during a remote examination or Super Code Challenge
* Use of previously authored code during an examination
* Copying from the examination or work of another person or source
* Submission or use of falsified data
* Use of the Zoom chat feature to pass answers during an examination

_Plagiarism is defined as the use of work or concepts contributed by other individuals without proper attribution or citation. Unique ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged in written, academic work, or blog posts. Examples of sources expected to be referenced include but are not limited to:_

* Text, either written or spoken that is quoted directly
* Graphic elements
* Scientific Data
* Concepts or material derived from the work (published or unpublished) of another person
