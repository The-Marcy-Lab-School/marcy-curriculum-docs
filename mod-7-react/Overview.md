# Mod 7 Overview

Frameworks and Libraries are what make web development so powerful, and so complex. Each framework or library seeks to improve upon some otherwise tedious or disorganized process, promising ease of use and optimizations. Learning how to learn a new framework is an essential skill in the modern age of web development. So, in this module, we will learn React, one of the most popular and in-demand frameworks, used for building smooth and beautiful user interfaces.

In this module, we'll learn about:

* **React** — a popular library for creating user interfaces through component composition.
* **Component Composition** — the act of designing a user interface based on discrete, reusable components that can share information with each other.
* **React Router** — a library made for React that can implements client-side frontend routing.
* **Frontend Routing** — the act of showing different user interfaces depending on the current URL (e.g. the `/about` vs. the `/contact` page)
* **Client-Side Routing** — a strategy for frontend routing in which the server sends a single set of static assets to the client that are able to change the user interface depending on the current URL.
* **Server-Side Routing** — a strategy for frontend routing in which the server sends different static assets to the client depending on the current URL.
