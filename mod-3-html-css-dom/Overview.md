# Mod 2 - HTML, CSS & the DOM

We can use JavaScript to do more than just write command-line scripts. We can also use it to power dynamic frontend applications. In this module, we'll learn how to scaffold and design a frontend web application using HTML and CSS and how to make them interactive and dynamic using the Document Object Model (a.k.a "The DOM").

In this module, we'll learn about:

* **HTML** — The markup language used to create the structure and content for websites.
* **CSS** — The styling language used to define the layout, spacing, colors, fonts, and more for websites.
* **Accessible Design** — Designing for users with a wide range of abilities and disabilities, focusing on removing barriers to access and ensuring usability for everyone.
* **The Document Object Model (DOM)** — A hierarchical JavaScript representation of a website's structure and content.
* **The Document Object Model (DOM) API** — The set of objects and methods for manipulating the DOM.
* **localStorage** — A cache provided by the browser for storing data locally on the user's computer.
* **localStorage API** — The set of objects and methods for manipulating localStorage.
