## Key Terms

* **Box Model** — How elements in an HTML document are modeled in the browser and how their dimensions are calculated based on the provided CSS properties. It consists of content, padding, border, and margin.
* The **content** — the space that the content of an element occupies (the text of a `<p>` tag, the image of an `img` tag, etc...)
  * Content can be modified with the `width` and `height` properties.
* The **padding**  — the space around the content but inside the border. This is the "background" of the content.
  * Padding can be modified with the `padding` property.
* The **border** — the space around the padding.
  * Border can be modified with the `border` and `border-radius` properties.
* The **margin** — the space around the border and "between" adjacent elements.
  * Margin can be modified with the `margin` property.
  * Note: Margin is always transparent and the margins of adjacent elements can overlap.
* The `box-sizing` property determines how the total width and height of an element is calculated. 
  * The default `box-sizing: content-box` setting has the `width` and `height` properties affect the content box, with padding and border dimensions added. 
  * The `box-sizing:border-box` setting makes the `width` and `height` properties affect the border box, with the content box automatically shrinking to fit inside the padding box.
* A **CSS Reset** is a set of rules intended to remove default CSS styles applied by the _user agent stylesheet_. 

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

* The `display` property changes how elements are arranged relative to each other:
  * `display: block` elements will stack on top of each other, regardless of their width.
  * `display: inline` elements will sit next to each other (if there is space available) and are not affected by the `width` or `height` properties
  * `display: inline-block` elements will sit next to each other (if there is space available) and ARE affected by the `width` and `height` properties
  * `display: none` elements are removed from the flow of the document.

## Web Design: Everything is a Box

You are a new web developer and you want to learn how to make pretty websites, right?

The first rule to understanding web design is that **in an HTML website, everything is a box**.

![](img/everything-is-a-box.png)

This becomes immediately clear when you add this CSS rule to a page:

```css
/* All elements have a 1px solid red border */
* {
  border: 1px solid red;
}
```

Knowing that everything is a box, we must start by learning how to control those boxes.

## Box Model

The **box model** defines the size and spacing of any element and it consists of 4 parts:

![The box model has 4 parts: the content, the padding, the border, and the margin](img/margin-padding-content.png)

* The **content** — the space that the content of an element occupies (the text of a `<p>` tag, the image of an `img` tag, etc...)
  * Content can be modified with the `width` and `height` properties.
* The **padding**  — the space around the content but inside the border. This is the "background" of the content.
  * Padding can be modified with the `padding` property.
* The **border** — the space around the padding.
  * Border can be modified with the `border` and `border-radius` properties.
* The **margin** — the space around the border and "between" adjacent elements.
  * Margin can be modified with the `margin` property.
  * Note: Margin is always transparent and the margins of adjacent elements can overlap.

For example, consider the following styles applied to `p` elements:

```css
p {
  /* Adding a background helps us see the different parts of the box model */
  background: gold;

  /* Box Model Properties */
  width: 100px;
  height: 50px;
  padding: 5px;
  border: 4px solid purple;
  margin: 10px;
}
```

Resulting in the output below:

**Tip:** View your styles using the developer tools! Clicking on an element in the **Elements** tab will pull up the CSS applied to that element in the **Styles** sub-tab.

### Sizing is Based on the Content Box

An important detail to note is that the `width` and `height` properties affect the **content box**. As a result, by default, the total space that an element occupies is not the same as its `width` and `height`.

**<details><summary>Question: What is the total width and height of the paragraph elements in the example above (excluding the margins)?</summary>**

The total width excluding the margins is 100 + 10 + 8 or 118 (the sum of the content, the padding, and the border).

The total height excluding the margins is 50 + 10 + 8 or 68 (the sum of the content, the padding, and the border).
</details>

Now, Imagine you had a screen that was `1000px` wide and you needed to fit 5 elements perfectly inside that space. However, each element includes `10px` of padding and a `2px` border. 

**<details><summary>Question: What would the `width` property need to be?</summary>**
The answer is `176px`. We take `1000px` and divide it by 5 to get `200px` for each element. Then, we need to also subtract the padding and border from both sides (`200px` minus `20px` of padding minus `4px` of border).
</details>

We can greatly simplify this by changing the `box-sizing` of an element:

```css
p {
  background: gold;

  box-sizing: border-box;
  /* Now, width and height are the total width and height */
  width: 100px;
  height: 50px;
  padding: 5px;
  border: 4px solid purple;
  margin: 10px;

}
```

The `box-sizing: border-box` style makes it so that the `width` and `height` properties _include_ the padding and border.

As a result, the size of the content box shrinks so that the total width and height of the "border box" matches the `width` and `height` properties.

**<details><summary>Question: What would the `width` property need to be with `box-sizing: border-box`?</summary>**

If we set `box-sizing: border-box` the answer is `200px`! 

</details>

### Box Model Defaults and a CSS Reset

Consider the website below which can be found in the `1-box-model-basics` folder. 

You can see the HTML structure contains some common HTML elements like `h1`, `h2`, `p`, `div`, `ul`, and `li`. To help see the where each element's box begins and ends, we've added `background` colors to each element and a `border` to all elements:

![The index.html file in the 1-box-model-basics folder](img/box-model-defaults.png)

In the **Styles** panel of our developer tools, the browser has applied some default styles via the **user agent stylesheet**. For example, the `h1` element has these styles:

```css
/* User Agent Stylesheet */
h1 {
    display: block;
    font-size: 2em;
    margin-block-start: 0.67em;
    margin-block-end: 0.67em;
    margin-inline-start: 0px;
    margin-inline-end: 0px;
    font-weight: bold;
    unicode-bidi: isolate;
}
```

As you can see if you poke around in the example, most elements have some default `margin` and `padding` styles which can conflict with any styling that we want to apply. 

To address this, it is common to define a **CSS Reset** rule that eliminates those default styles:

```css
* {
  /* Remove the default margin and padding applied to many elements, giving us full control over spacing */
  margin: 0px;
  padding: 0px;

  /* Makes `width` apply to the border box (padding and content are included) */
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

ul {
  list-style: none;
}
```

In addition to resetting the `margin` and `padding` for all elements to `0px`, we change the `box-sizing` property to `border-box`.

I also like to remove bullets from `ul` elements.

## Display and Position

### Display
* Notice how the `div` and `p` tags each get a new line, but the `a` and `img` tags are in the same line? 
* That's because their `display` is different:

| Display Type            | New Line? | Accepts Height / Width?                    | When To Use                                                       | Default Elements |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `display: block;`       | Yes!      | Yes!                                       | When you want things on a new line.                               | Most things!     |
| `display: inline`       | No        | No (but accepts horizontal padding/margin) | For inserting an element within an existing line of text content. | span, b, i, a    |
| `display: inline-block` | No        | Yes!                                       | Buttons in a navigation bar!                                      | None             |
| `display: none`         | N/A       | N/A                                        | To completely remove an element from view.                        | None             |


See what happens when you assign each type of `display` to `div` an `a` and an `img` tag! 


### Position
We can also directly control positioning of our elements on the page through "position." This is a very powerful, **but very finicky tool**.

Use this [interactive documentation on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) to play around with it.

- `position: static`
  - Elements render in normal document flow and no offset values can move statically positioned elements
- `position: relative`
  - Elements are positioned relative to their normal position
  - Offset properties like `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`, etc. can move elements from their original spot
  - Other content flows around the *original* position

- `position: absolute`
  - Elements removed from normal document flow, and other elements will be able to fill that space
  - Positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor.
    - This is important, as if the parent isn't `absolute` or `relative` then the child will be positioned relative to the entire body
    - I've included a parent div for the two rectangles exactly for this reason, so experiment with adding/removing `relative` to i

- `position: fixed`
  - Behaves like absolute positioning, except its positioned to the viewport

- `position: sticky`
  - this will behave like `relative` until you scroll past it, then it will stick on the top bottom or sides
  - Finicky, be careful about parents blocking it
