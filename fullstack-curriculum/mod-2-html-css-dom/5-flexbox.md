## Part 0 - Explore Flexbox on Youtube

> **Pacing:** 5 minutes (5 minutes total)
> **Learning Objectives:** See Flexbox in the real world
> * Open https://www.youtube.com/ and see how elements shift in size as you resize the window. Point out the the videos that are aligned next to each other are NOT inline, they are flex items.

Flexbox does a few things: 
1. puts things in a row (or column if you need to)
2. makes things stretchy
3. control the relative size of elements in a row

## Part 1 - Flex Containers and Flex Items

> **Pacing**: 5 minutes (10 minutes total)
> **Learning Objective:** identify flex containers / flex items
> * Briefly define what Flexbox is and make sure they can identify the terms "flex container" and "flex items"

* Flexbox is used for **organizing elements in a single direction**
* `display: flex` defines a **flex container**. 
* The children of the flex container are **flex items**
* By default, flex items are placed in a row

## Part 2 - Demo Styling a Navbar using Flexbox Container Properties

> **Pacing:** 15 minutes (25 minutes total)
> **Learning Objective:** see what Flexbox can do
> * Have fellows follow along with you. This is just to show them what Flexbox can do. After, we'll see what makes Flexbox work. Open up the `1-navbar/` directory and the `index.html` and `index.css` files. 
> * Serve using live preview. Start by uncommenting the styles of the `ul` to show how `display: flex` styles the the block elements to be aligned horizontally. Then insert a gap. Then do the same for the `header`, discussing briefly `justify-content` and `align-items`

* Ordinarily, elements are `display: block` elements are stacked on top of each other.
* `display: flex` arranges flex items horizontal
* Making a navigation bar is one of the common applications of Flexbox since **we typically want to align navigation elements horizontally**.

![Without Flexbox, items are aligned vertically. With Flexbox, we can align items horizontally with nice spacing](./img/flexbox-comparison.png)

```css
header {
  display: flex; /* Makes the header a flex container */
  justify-content: space-between; /* main-axis spacing */
  align-items: center; /* cross-axis spacing */
}

ul {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1rem; /* increasing spacing between flex items */
}
```

* The essential **flex container properties** are:
  * `justify-content` — defines alignment along the **main axis**
  * `align-items` — defines alignment along the **cross axis**
  * `gap` — controls spacing _between_ flex items (not on outer edges)
  * `flex-direction` - defaults to `row` but can be set to `column` to arrange flex items vertically.


## Part 3 - Flexbox Main and Cross Axes

> **Pacing:** 10 minutes (35 minutes total)
> **Learning Objective:** Understand that Flexbox containers have two axes: main and cross
> * Now that we've seen what Flexbox can do, we can dive deeper into how Flexbox works. Explore how direction changes the axes and how justify-content and align-items work.

* Flexbox has two axes, the **main axis** and the **cross axis**

### Justify Content

* `justify-content` affects the positioning of flex items along the **main axis**

![Justify content values showing flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around](./img/justify-content.png)

### Align Items

* `align-items` affects the positioning of flex items along the **cross axis**

![Align items values showing flex-start, flex-end, center, stretch, baseline](./img/align-items.png)

### Flex Direction

* `flex-direction: column` changes the orientation of the main and cross axes. 
  * The main axis is now vertical
  * The cross axis is now horizontal

## Part 4 - Growing and Shrinking

> **Pacing:** 15 minutes (50 minutes total)
> **Learning Objective:** See how flex items behave when space is limited.
> * Now open the `2-flexing/` directory and serve the `index.html` page.
> * Here we want to demonstrate how the `flex-wrap`, `flex-basis` and `flex-grow` properties all control how flex items behave when space is limited. Show first what the default behavior of flex items is without any of these values set. Then add/remove them to show the difference. 
> `flex-basis` often causes confusion since it is similar (but different) from setting the `width` of each flex item.

### Flex Wrap

* By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line.

![Alt text](./img/flex-wrap.png)

```css
.container {
  flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
}
```

### Flex Grow

* `flex-grow` defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. 

![Alt text](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/flex-grow.svg)

* It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. 
* It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.

```css
.flex-item { flex-grow: 1 }
.flex-item:nth-child(2) { 
  flex-grow: 2
}
```

* If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. 
* If one of the children has a value of 2, that child would take up twice as much of the space either one of the others (or it will try, at least).

### Equal Columns

* To achieve equal columns, we need to ensure that each flex item starts with the same size (`flex-basis: 0%`) and will grow/shrink at the same rate (`flex-grow: 1` and `flex-shrink: 1`).

```css
.flex-item {
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-shrink: 1;
  flex-basis: 0;
  /* flex: 1 1 0; */
  /* flex: 1; */
}
```

* The `flex` property can serve as a short-hand for all three: `flex: 1 1 0%`
* The default is `0 1 auto`, but if you set it with a single number value, like `flex: 5;`, that changes the `flex-basis` to `0%`, so it’s like setting `flex-grow: 5; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: 0%;`.
