## Terms

* **Flexbox** - a `display` type that arranges flexible elements in a container in a row or column.
* **Flex Container** - the element with `display:flex`.
* **Flex Item** - an element inside of a flex container.
* **Main Axis** — the direction that flex items flow in, (set by `flex-direction` and in the `row` direction by default).
* **Cross Axis** — the direction perpendicular to the main axis.
* The essential **flex container properties** are:
  * `flex-direction` - Determines the direction flex items will be arranged. Defaults to `row` but can be set to `column` to arrange flex items vertically.
  * `justify-content` — defines the spacing along the **main axis**
  * `align-items` — defines the alignment of elements along the **cross axis**
  * `gap` — controls spacing _between_ flex items (not on outer edges)
* The essential **flex item properties** are:
  * `flex-grow` — defines the amount a flex item will grow relative to its siblings when there is excess space.
  * `flex-shrink` — defines the amount a flex item will shrink relative to its siblings when there is not enough space.
  * `flex-basis` — defines the starting size of a flex item.
  * `flex` — used as shorthand for the above 3 properties.

![Flex containers and flex items](img/flex-container-items.png)

* **Flexbox** is a display type used for arranging elements inside of a container in a row or a column.
* The parent element gets the `display: flex` property, making it a **flex container**. 
* The children of the flex container automatically become **flex items**

## Flexbox Puts Things In A Row

With Flexbox, the most common use case is arranging identical elements in a row that will grow or shrink according to the available space. 

Consider the following HTML:

{% code title="0-flexbox-demo/index.html"%}
```html
<div class="flex-container" id="squares-container">
  <div class="flex-item">A</div>
  <div class="flex-item">AB</div>
  <div class="flex-item">ABC</div>
  <div class="flex-item">ABCD</div>
  <div class="flex-item">ABCDE</div>
</div>
```
{% endcode %}

By default these elements elements will stack on top of each other.


![block elements will stack on top of each other](img/before-flexbox.png)

**<details><summary>Q: Why is this the default behavior of divs?</summary>**
> By default, `div` elements will be block elements. Block elements always stack on top of each other and take up the full width available to them.
</details>

By setting the adding Flexbox to the parent container (the `div.flex-container` element), its children will be placed horizontally in a row! 


![Adding display:flex will place the flex items in a row](img/display-flex.png)
```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
}
```

The flex items will all stretch vertically to have equal height but will only take up as much width as is needed.

## Controlling Flex Items

With Flexbox applied to the parent container, we gain access to a bunch of options for arranging the flex items inside.

We can control:
1. the direction that flex items flow with `flex-direction`
2. how much space is between flex items with `gap`
3. how the flex items grow or shrink along the main axis with `flex`
4. how flex items are spaced along the main axis with `justify-content`
5. how flex items are stretch and are positioned along the cross axis with `align-items`
6. whether or not flex items wrap when they can't fit in one line with `flex-wrap``

Let's jump into each!

### Flex Direction (Flex Container Property)

Flexbox has two axes, the **main axis** and the **cross axis**. Flex items flow along the main axis and, by default stretch along the cross axis.

![flexbox has two axes, the main axis and the cross axis](img/flex-box-axes.svg)

By default, the main axis runs in the "row" direction, arranged left to right. 

We can arrange flex items in a column (top to bottom) by setting the `flex-direction` property to `column`:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

`flex-direction: column` changes the orientation of the main and cross axes. 
* The main axis is now vertical (top to bottom)
* The cross axis is now horizontal (left to right)

Knowing the direction of these two axes plays an essential role in controlling how flex items behave inside of a flex container. Let's look at how!

### Gap (Flex Container Property)

Gap is perhaps the most useful feature of Flexbox. The `gap` property makes adding space between elements incredibly easy:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

Note that the gap will only be applied to the space between the elements, not before the first element and after the last element.

**<details><summary>Q: Why can't we just use margin to do this?</summary>**
Thus far, if we've wanted to put space between elements, we've had to rely on adding a `margin`. However, margins have a few behaviors that can be annoying to deal with:
* Margins are applied to all sides, making it difficult to only add space *between* elements (the first and last elements will have extra margin on top and bottom)
* Margins can overlap causing unexpected spacing 

Gap solves these problems entirely!
</details>


### Flex (Flex Item Property)

The `flex` property controls how much a flex item will grow or shrink within a container when there is extra space. 

By default, flex items will only take up as much space as they need. However, if there is extra space, flex items with the `flex` property will flex to take up that space.  

![](img/flex-demo.gif)

```css
/* The flex property controls the relative "growth rate" of a flex item when there is excess space */
.flex-item {
  flex: 1;
}

/* Hovering over a flex item will cause it to grow 3x the size of other flex items */
.flex-item:hover {
  flex: 3;
}
```

With `flex: 1;` applied to all flex items, they will all attempt to share the extra space evenly. 

With `flex: 3;` applied to the one hovered element, it will take 3 times as much extra space as the other elements.

{% hint style="info" %}
`flex` is a shorthand for the three properties `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`. Read more about [the flex property on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex)!
{% endhint %}

### Justify Content (Flex Container Property)

By default, flex items will arrange themselves at the start of the *main axis* (left to right in the row direction) of the flex container. We can change this behavior using `justify-content`:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

![Justify content values showing flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around](img/justify-content.png)

### Align Items (Flex Container Property)

By default, flex items will stretch along the *cross axis*. We can change this behavior using `align-items`.


```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-start;
}
```

![Align items values showing flex-start, flex-end, center, stretch, baseline](img/align-items.png)

### Flex Wrap (Flex Container Property)

By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. If there isn't enough space, they will overflow.

Setting `flex-wrap: wrap`, flex items will be pushed to the next line when there isn't enough space.

![Alt text](img/flex-wrap.png)

```css
.container {
  flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
}
```

## Challenge: Styling a Navbar using Flexbox

One of the most common uses of flexbox is to style a navigation bar. Open up [`1-navbar`](./lecture/1-navbar/) and look at the `<header>` element:

```html
<!-- Often, the header contains a logo and a nav component -->
<header>
  <p id="header-logo">Ben's Blog</p>
  <nav>
    <!-- It is common to put a ul inside with links as list items -->
    <ul id="nav-links">
      <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
```

Below, you can see what the header currently looks like (left) and what we want it to look like (right). What is different?

![Without flexbox, items are aligned vertically. With flex box, we can align items horizontally with nice spacing](img/flexbox-comparison.png)

**Q: How do we fix this?**

**<details><summary>Solution</summary>**

* Most elements are `display: block` which means they are stacked on top of each other.
* We can apply `display: flex` to a parent element to put its children in a row horizontally

```css
header {
  display: flex; /* Makes the header a flex container */
  justify-content: space-between; /* main-axis spacing */
  align-items: center; /* cross-axis spacing */
}

ul {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1rem; /* increasing spacing between flex items */
}
```

* The essential **flex container properties** are:
  * `justify-content` — defines alignment along the **main axis**
  * `align-items` — defines alignment along the **cross axis**
  * `gap` — controls spacing _between_ flex items (not on outer edges)
  * `flex-direction` - defaults to `row` but can be set to `column` to arrange flex items vertically.
