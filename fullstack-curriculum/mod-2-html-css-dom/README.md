# Mod 2 - HTML, CSS & the DOM

We can use JavaScript to do more than just write command-line scripts. We can also use it to power dynamic frontend applications. In this module, we'll learn how to scaffold and design a frontend web application using HTML and CSS and how to make them interactive and dynamic using the Document Object Model (a.k.a "The DOM").

In this module, we'll learn about:

* **HTML**
* **CSS**
* **Accessibility**
* **The Document Object Model (DOM)**
* **LocalStorage**
