## Comments
This *looks* like a super heavy lecture, but remember this is now the *third* time we've seen a lot of this material. Don't dwell on the review sections and instead focus on new things like scope, hoisting, declarations vs expressions, and the new string methods.

Also, since we're jumping around in terms of topics so much, the main lecture files have been numbered to keep track with the main lecture. Timeline is still here because some files have heavier additions than others or hop back and forth (like function hoisting to scopes, back to function hoisting).

## Skills we're teaching
- (CORE) const vs let vs var - **REVIEW**
- (CORE) To avoid variable hoisting
- (CORE) Primitive Data Types - **REVIEW**
- NaN
- (CORE) old function declarations get hoisted
- (CORE) arrow expressions do not
- (CORE) params/args and return values - **REVIEW**
- (CORE) Rough intro to concept of scope
- scope can see up, not down
- (CORE) Why hoisting + scope is why we avoid `function` for now
- (CORE) String indexes and .length - **REVIEW**
- (CORE) How to make string templates - **REVIEW**
- backticks keep newlines
- special \t \n chars
- when templates vs concatenation
- (CORE) Know these str methods
  - .includes, .indexOf, .toUpper/LowerCase, .slice - **REVIEW**
- Familiar with
  - .lastIndexOf, .replace, .replaceAll

## Expected Existing skills
- used let and const
- knows number, string, boolean data types
- used arrow functions
- know what indexes are
- used a few string methods
