## Terms:

* **React** — a library for building reusable, composable, and scalable user-interfaces made up of components.
* **Component** — a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. Components are functions that return JSX.
* **JSX** — an extension of JavaScript that lets you write HTML in React components.
* **Component Composition** — the process of combining smaller, reusable components together to create larger, more complex components
* **Root Component** — the top-level component that all other components are children of. Typically called `App`.
* **`react-dom/client`** — a React package that lets you render React components on the client (in the browser)
* **Prop** — a piece of data passed from a parent component to a child component.

## What is React and Why Use It?

**React** is a JavaScript library for building user-interfaces (UI).

React focuses on building reusable **components** that can be composed into larger components. This allows developers to build applications that scale efficiently.

### A. Say goodbye to the clunky DOM API

Compare and contrast these code snippets for creating a dynamic text element.

Vanilla JS with the DOM API (imperative style):

```js
const makeTextElement = (message) => {
  const p = document.createElement("p");
  p.className = "header";
  p.innerText = message;
  return p;
};
```

React (declarative style):

```jsx
const Text = ({ message }) => {
  return <p className="header">{message}</p>;
};
// This HTML-like syntax ^ is JSX
```

In React, we are able to return markup language (like HTML) from functions. This is called **JSX** (JavaScript XML).

### B. Component Composition is fast and easy to read

**Components** let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

**Component Composition** is the process of combining smaller, reusable components together to create larger, more complex components

Vanilla JS with the DOM API (imperative style):

```js
const makeCatInstaElement = () => {
  const container = document.createElement("div");
  container.className = "insta-pic";

  const caption = document.createElement("p");
  caption.className = "caption";
  caption.innerText = "cute cat pics";

  const img = document.createElement("img");
  img.src = "img/cat.jpeg";

  container.append(img, caption);
  return container;
};
```

React (declarative style):

```jsx
const Picture = ({ src }) => {
  return <img src={src} />;
};

const Caption = ({ text }) => {
  return <figcaption className="caption">{text}</figcaption>;
};

const InstagramPost = () => {
  return (
    <figure className="insta-pic">
      <Picture src="./images/my-cat.jpg" />
      <Caption text="cute cat" />
    </figure>
  );
};
```

Notice that `<Caption />` and `<Picture />` start with a capital letter. That’s how you know it’s a React **component**.

React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.

### C. The Virtual DOM offers some performance benefits when re-rendering components

## Starting a React Project with Vite

Now that you know at least some of the basic terms of React, let's look at actually building a React app.

All of our projects up until this point have used Vanilla JS. Today is the day where you get to create a vite project using React!!!

```bash
npm create vite@latest
# Choose Project Name
? Project name: <name of your project>
# select React
# select JavaScript

cd <name of your project> && npm i
npm run dev
```

By default you will be given a counter app. Take a look around!

Every React project will have this rough structure:

* `index.html` — the HTML file served to the client. It loads `src/main.jsx`.
* `src/main.jsx` — the entry point of the app. It uses the `react-dom/client` package to render the **root component** `App` into the DOM.
* `src/App.jsx` — the root component.

> Notice the `.jsx` extension? Without it, we wouldn't be able to write JSX in this file.

## Rendering the Root Component With ReactDOM

How does all of this actually get to the screen? Head over to the `main.jsx` file.

The primary purpose of this file is render the root component `App`. To do so we:

* Import a package called `ReactDOM`
* Use the `ReactDOM.createRoot` method to create a `root` object.
* Then we call `root.render` and pass in the `App` component.

This is mostly handled when Vite creates the project for you so no need to memorize it:

```jsx
// main.jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.jsx'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

A few notes:

* We're using the `client` version of `ReactDOM` (there is also a `native` version for mobile).
* `React.StrictMode` is a wrapper-component that detects potential React-related in our application. It doesn't render anything visible.

## Components and JSX

React components are functions that return a single JSX element.

The first component that we create is typically called `App`

```jsx
// inside App.jsx
const App = () => {
  return (
    <header>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>It's a great day</p>
    </header>
  )
}

export default App
```

* Component are functions that return JSX.
* Note the capitalized name. All components must use PascalCasing.
* Components must return a single surrounding element. Here, we return a `header`.
* When returning multiple elements, wrap the elements parentheses `()`.

## Nested Components

React is at its best when we separate the UI into individual components and then combine them to create the entire UI.

To render a component inside another component, we use the name of the component as if it were a self-closing HTML tag: `<ComponentName />`

```jsx
const Header = () => {
  return <h1>My Pet Pics</h1>;
};

const InstagramPost = () => {
  return (
    <figure>
      <img alt="Reggie the cat" src="images/cat.jpeg" />
      <figcaption>Check out my cute cat Reggie!</figcaption>
    </figure>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <> 
      <Header />
      <InstagramPost />
    </>
  );
};

export default App
```

**Q: Compare and Contrast how each of these components return their children. What do you notice?**

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

* `InstagramPost` and `App` each return more than one line of JSX so the returned value is wrapped in `()`
* The `App` component uses fragments (`<>`) to wrap its child elements while `InstagramPost` uses a `<figure>`. Fragments let you group elements without a wrapper node. It is the same as if the elements were not grouped.

</details>

## Adding Style

Imagine we had this style rule defined in a CSS file:

```css
.red {
  color: red;
}
```

We can add style by using the `className` attribute. Note that we aren't using `class`. In React, many of the HTML attributes that we've grown accustomed to will have _slightly_ different names.

```jsx
const Message = () => {
  return <p className="red">Hello World!</p>;
};

const Messages = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Message />
      <Message />
      <Message />
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <NameHeader />
      <Messages />
      <InstagramPost />
    </>
  );
};
```

<details>

<summary><strong>Q: What will this render?</strong></summary>



<img src="img/message-example.png" alt="" data-size="original">

Note how the `className` attribute in JSX is converted into the HTML attribute `class`.

We can't use the name `class` for this attribute because it is a reserved keyword in JavaScript.

The `for` attribute for `<label>` elements is another example of this. Instead, we use the `htmlFor` attribute.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Q: How can I add a <code>class="insta-pic"</code> attribute to the <code>img</code> in my <code>InstagramPost</code> component?</strong></summary>


```jsx
const InstagramPost = () => {
  return (
    <figure >
      <img alt="Reggie the cat" src="images/cat.jpeg" className="insta-pic"/>
      <figcaption>Check out my cute cat Reggie!</figcaption>
    </figure>
  );
};
```

</details>

## Inserting Data Into Components

JSX let's you put markup into our JavaScript.

We can also insert JavaScript into our JSX using curly braces `{}`.

```jsx
const catPicture = {
  alt: "Reggie the cat",
  src: "images/cat.jpeg",
  caption: "Check out my cute cat Reggie!"
}

const InstagramPost = () => {
  return (
    <figure>
      <img 
        src={catPicture.src} 
        alt={`Photo of ${catPicture.alt}`}  
        className="insta-pic" 
      />
      <figcaption style={{ fontStyle: 'italic' }}>{catPicture.caption}</figcaption>
    </figure>
  );
};
```

Notice how the `alt` attribute uses string concatenation!

In the above example, `style={{}}` is not a special syntax, but a regular `{}` object inside the `style={ }` JSX curly braces. You can use the `style` attribute when your styles depend on JavaScript variables.

## Sharing Data Between Components With Props

What makes React so powerful is the ability to share data between components using **props**.

Every React function-component is passed an argument called `props`. It is an object containing properties provided to the component by the parent.

In this example, the parent component is `App` and it provides a `pictureData` prop to each instance of the `InstagramPost` component.

```jsx
const catPicture = {
  alt: "Reggie the cat",
  src: "images/cat.jpeg",
  caption: "Check out my cute cat Reggie!"
}
const dogPicture = {
  alt: "Robert the dog",
  src: "images/dog.jpeg",
  caption: "Check out my cute dog Robert!"
}
const duckPicture = {
  alt: "Daffy the Duck",
  src: "images/duck.jpeg",
  caption: "Check out my cute duck Daffy!"
}

const InstagramPost = ({ pictureData }) => {
  return (
    <figure>
      <img 
        src={pictureData.src} 
        alt={`Photo of ${pictureData.alt}`}  
        className="insta-pic" 
      />
      <figcaption style={{ fontStyle: 'italic' }}>{pictureData.caption}</figcaption>
    </figure>
  );
};

// Root component
function App() {
  // Component composition
  return (
    <>
      <h1>My Pet Pics</h1>
      <InstagramPost pictureData={catPicture} />
      <InstagramPost pictureData={dogPicture} />
      <InstagramPost pictureData={duckPicture} />
    </>
  )
}
```

**Q: What will this render?**

## Rendering A List of Elements

* Use array to store data
* Render `{array.map}`
* Give each element a `key` that should be unique (using the index of the array is okay but not ideal)

```jsx
const InstagramPost = ({ pictureData }) => {
  /* ... */
};

// Array of data
const pictures = [
  {
    id: 1,
    alt: "Reggie the cat",
    src: "images/cat.jpeg",
    caption: "Check out my cute cat Reggie!"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    alt: "Robert the dog",
    src: "images/dog.jpeg",
    caption: "Check out my cute dog Robert!"
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    alt: "Daffy the Duck",
    src: "images/duck.jpeg",
    caption: "Check out my cute duck Daffy!"
  }
]

// Render the array in a ul
const PicturesList = () => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {
        pictures.map((picture) => {
          return (
            <InstagramPost key={picture.id} pictureData={picture} />
          );
        })
      }
    </ul>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <PicturesList />
    </>
  );
};
```

### Under the hood: JSX Code must be compiled

JSX in our code (`<h1>...</h1>`) cannot simply be executed by our browser. It must first be **compiled** (converted) to vanilla JS.

<details><summary>See what this code would look like if it were written without JSX</summary>

> Note how we have to use `React.createElement` here

> ```js
> const rootEl = document.getElementById("root");
> const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootEl);
>
> root.render(React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello World"));
> ```

</details>

Vite is doing the heavy lifting when it comes to the rendering.
