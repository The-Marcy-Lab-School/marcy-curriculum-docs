# Mod 5 - Server-Side Development

Backend encompasses quite a lot and requires you to shift your thinking to a higher level. Instead of worrying about every tiny detail, you must expand your view to learn entire systems of functions that interact with each other to create an entire application. There will be many things that you don't fully understand and you will learn to be alright with that. To succeed in this module, you must hone your skills of **systems-level thinking**, **building mental models**, and **detail orientation**.

In this module, we'll learn about:

* **Backend** — the part of the application that the user can't access. For our purposes, this means a server application and a database.
  * **Server Applications** — Application to receive requests and send back resources.
    * **Express** — The npm package we'll use to build a server application.
  * **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design** — A framework for organizing the layers of software that make up the backend.
