## GitHub Project Checklist

### Workflow Best Practices

GitHub workflow best practices are essential for maintaining code quality, enabling collaboration, and demonstrating professional development skills. Following established workflows helps:

* Keep code organized and maintainable
* Prevent conflicts and code loss
* Enable effective team collaboration
* Track project history and changes
* Make it easier to identify and fix bugs
* Demonstrate familiarity with industry standards
* Build trust with potential employers and collaborators

To ensure that your project development goes smoothly and results in a polished repository, follow these best practices:

1. **Scrum Board Management**
   * Create a project board using GitHub Projects
   * Break down work into clear, actionable tasks
   * Use consistent card structure:
     * Descriptive title that identifies the task
     * Clear acceptance criteria or definition of done
     * Any relevant links or dependencies
   * Organize cards into standard columns:
     * Backlog - Future work not yet prioritized
     * Todo - Prioritized work ready to start
     * In Progress - Work actively being done
     * Done - Completed work that meets acceptance criteria
   * Keep board up to date:
     * Move cards as work progresses
     * Add new tasks as they are identified
     * Archive completed cards regularly
   * Link GitHub issues and PRs to relevant cards
2. **Branch Management**
   * Create feature branches for all new work
   * Use descriptive branch names (e.g. `feature/add-login`, `bugfix/fix-navbar`)
   * Delete branches after merging to keep repository clean
   * Protect the main branch from direct pushes

3. **Commit Strategy** 
   * Make small, focused commits that do one thing
   * Write clear commit messages with a subject line and description
   * Use conventional commit prefixes (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
   * Commit frequently to create detailed history

4. **Pull Request Process**
   * Include clear PR descriptions explaining changes
   * Reference related scrum board tickets in PR description
   * When working on teams:
     * Request reviews from appropriate team members
     * Address all review feedback before merging
  
### Code Quality Best Practices

Code quality is a critical indicator of your professionalism and development maturity. Clean, well-organized code demonstrates:
* Attention to detail and pride in your work
* Consideration for other developers who may read or maintain your code
* Understanding of software engineering best practices
* Ability to write maintainable, scalable solutions

Following code quality best practices makes your projects more impressive to potential employers and collaborators. Key practices include:
* **Remove unused code** - Delete commented-out code, unused functions, and dead code
* **Write meaningful comments**- Explain why, not what; focus on complex business logic
* **Use descriptive variable names** - Choose names that clearly indicate purpose
* **Keep functions small** - Each function should have a single, clear responsibility
* **Follow consistent formatting** - Use linters and formatters to maintain code style
* **Add error handling** - Properly handle and log errors throughout the codebase
* **Write tests** - Include unit tests, integration tests, or other relevant test coverage
* **Document complex algorithms** - Add comments explaining non-obvious logic

### README File

A README file is a crucial component of any GitHub repository. It serves as the landing page and first point of contact for visitors to your project. A well-written README helps others understand your project quickly, demonstrates professionalism, and increases the likelihood that others will use, contribute to, or hire you based on your work.

Key reasons why READMEs are important:
* They provide essential documentation that helps users understand and use your project
* They demonstrate your ability to communicate technical concepts clearly
* They show attention to detail and commitment to software development best practices
* They make your project more discoverable through search engines
* They help potential employers evaluate your work

The following components are required of all GitHub projects:
1. **Project Title and Description**
   * Clear, concise title that describes the project
   * Brief overview explaining what the project does and its purpose
   * Any notable features or functionality

2. **Technologies Used**
   * List of programming languages
   * Frameworks and libraries
   * Database systems
   * Other relevant tools and technologies

3. **Installation Instructions**
   * Step-by-step guide for setting up the project locally
   * Required dependencies and versions
   * Environment variables or configuration needed
   * Commands to install, build, and run the project

4. **Usage Guide**
   * Instructions on how to use the application
   * Examples of common use cases
   * Screenshots or GIFs demonstrating functionality
   * API endpoints and their usage (if applicable)

The following components are nice-to-haves that will elevate your project's README:

5. **Contributing Guidelines**
   * How others can contribute to the project
   * Code style and standards to follow
   * Process for submitting pull requests
   * Any testing requirements

6. **Project Status**
   * Current development stage
   * Known issues or limitations
   * Future planned features or improvements
   * Latest stable version number

7. **Contact Information**
   * How to reach the maintainer(s)
   * Links to related documentation
   * Where to report bugs or request features

8. **License**
   * Type of license
   * Any usage restrictions
   * Attribution requirements

## Creating a Professional Github Profile

Your GitHub profile serves as your digital portfolio and professional presence in the developer community. It's often one of the first things potential employers or collaborators will look at to understand your skills, experience, and coding style. A well-crafted profile can help you stand out and demonstrate your commitment to software development.

To create a professional GitHub profile, you'll need to create a special repository that matches your GitHub username. For example, if your username is "janedoe", you would create a repository named "janedoe".

Steps to create/modify your profile:

1. Create a new repository with your GitHub username
2. Add a README.md file to this repository
3. This README will automatically appear on your profile page

The README.md can be customized with:
- Markdown formatting
- GitHub-specific features like:
  - Status badges
  - GitHub stats
  - Language usage charts
  - Custom images and GIFs
  
You can use tools like [GitHub Profile README Generator](https://rahuldkjain.github.io/gh-profile-readme-generator/) to help create an initial template, then customize it to match your style and highlight your achievements.

### Required Components

To ensure that your profile meets the expectations of potential employers, it should include the following components:

* **About Me Section**: Include an "about me" section that describes what you're currently learning, what you've learned, and a fun fact.

* **Links**: Link to your LinkedIn profile and any technical blog posts or demo videos you have.

* **Pinned Projects**: Pin your 3-4 most polished projects to your profile. Each of these projects should be completed using the GitHub Repo Project Checklist above
