# Overview

Object-Oriented Programming is a style of programming (a "paradigm") that uses **objects to manage state (data) and behavior** in an application. While OOP does let us do some new things, more than anything, it helps us write better, more organized code.

It can be defined by its 4 pillars:

* **Encapsulation** - bundling methods with the data they operate on while hiding / protecting access to the data
* **Abstraction** - creating interfaces that hiding complexity behind functions
* **Inheritance** - sharing behavior between classes
* **Polymorphism** - similar objects can be used interchangeably

![The four pillars of object oriented programming are abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.](../.gitbook/assets/oop-pillars.png)

Throughout this module, we will be learning about these four pillars and how we implement them in JavaScript using the `class` syntax.
