# Your First Fullstack App!

Remember, the **model** is the layer of the application that directly manipulates the data. It provides methods that the controllers can use to execute those changes whenever the frontend makes the appropriate request.

Thus far, our server application used an in-memory array as a "database". But this data is not persistent — each time we restart the server, all data created during that running session is lost.

Now that we have a database and can connect to it using Knex, we can refactor our model to use that database and have our data persist.

## Part 1 - Adding a DB for the fellows

Open the repository and start with the `2-fellow-tracker-final-mvc/` version of the project.

We need to create a database and then replace all logic associated with the in-memory `fellows` array used in the `server/model/Fellow` file with `knex` code to connect with our new database.

1. Start your Postgres server and create a database called `fellows_tracker` using TablePlus or the `psql` CLI.
2. Execute the SQL statement below to create the table structure

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE fellows (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      name TEXT NOT NULL
    )
    ```
3. Return to the repository and install `pg` and `knex` into the server directory. Then initialize `knexfile.js`:

    ```sh
    cd server
    npm i pg knex # install pg and knex
    npx knex init # create knexfile.js
    ```

4. Modify `knexfile.js` to use `pg` and the `fellow-tracker` database with a valid username and password:

    ```js
    development: {
      client: 'pg',
      connection: {
        user: 'postgres',
        password: 'postgres',
        database: 'fellow-tracker', 
      }
    },
    ```

5. Create a `knex.js` file in the `model/` directory that exports a `knex` object. Remember, this object will be shared by every model in our application to execute SQL statements to the database.

    * make sure the import statement for `knexfile.js` is accurate

    ```js
    // Set the deployment environment variable
    // Depending on where it is deployed, this could be "staging" or "production"
    const env = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';

    // Grab the corresponding knex configuration object from knexfile.js
    const knexConfig = require('../knexfile.js')[env];

    // Create the knex connection object using that config
    const knex = require('knex')(knexConfig);

    module.exports = knex;
    ```
## Part 2 — Refactor!

Knex is configured to connect to our database! Now we can execute SQL commands to the database using the `knex.raw()` method.

Head over to the `server/model/Fellow.js` file and remove all logic associated with the in-memory `fellows` array, replacing it with the appropriate `knex` and SQL logic.

Remember, `knex.raw()` returns a promise that resolves to an object with a `rows` array property, even if there is only one value returned by the query!

```js
const getPets = async () => {
  // knex.raw returns a query result object
  let result = await knex.raw("SELECT * FROM pets");
  
  // .rows is an array containing the query data
  return result.rows;
};
```

Here's what you need to do:
1. Import `knex` into the `Fellow` model
2. Remove the import of the `getId` function, the database will handle automatically setting the `id` property
3. Remove the `fellows` array
4. All methods need to be `async` to use `await knex.raw()`
5. Every function needs to return _something_ (use `RETURNING *` on all non-`SELECT` queries)
   1. `Fellow.create` should return the new fellow
   2. `Fellow.list` should return an array of all fellows
   3. `Fellow.find` should return a single fellow object (the first object in the `rows` array)
   4. `Fellow.editName` should return the updated fellow object
   5. `Fellow.delete` should return the deleted fellow object
6.  Refactor `fellowControllers.js` to `await` everything and double check that all values returned from the model are being handled properly.

## Part 3 - Adding posts

Here's where things get fun! We can add a `posts` table to our database that has a one-to-many relationship with our `fellows` table. Each post must have a `fellow_id` reference pointing to the fellow that created it.

1. Create a posts table that references the fellows table
2. Create a `Post` model with methods:
   * `create(content, fellowId)`
   * `findPostsByFellowId(fellowId)`
   * `delete(id)`
   * `deleteAllPostsForFellow(fellowId)`
   * `list()` — only used for testing
   * `findById(id)` — only used for testing
3. Make the `postControllers`
4. Define endpoints in `index.js`. Make sure to follow REST principles! Since every post is owned by a fellow, the endpoint should communicate that:
   * `POST /api/fellows/:fellowId/posts` → `Post.create`
   * `GET /api/fellows/:fellowId/posts` → `Post.findPostsByFellowId`
   * `DELETE /api/fellows/:fellowId/posts/:postId` → `Post.delete`
   * `DELETE /api/fellows/:fellowId/posts/` → `Post.deleteAllPostsForFellow`
5. Test with postman
6. Add frontend components and fetching on the `FellowDetails` page
   * You'll need the following components:
     * A form for adding a new post
     * A list of posts with delete buttons for each post
   * Event handlers / fetching:
     * `useEffect` now also fetches fellow posts -> `GET /api/fellows/:fellowId/posts`
     * new post form on submit -> `POST /api/fellows/:fellowId/posts/`
     * list item delete button on click -> `DELETE /api/posts/:id`
7. When deleting a fellow, we need to delete posts first. How can we ensure that this happens in the right order?
